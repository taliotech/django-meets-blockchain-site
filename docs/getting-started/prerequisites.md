## Prerequisites

You'll need to have several items ready to go before proceeding with this lab; these can be done in advance or before starting with the main instructions.

1. [Download and install **VirtualBox**](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
    - Be sure to download and install both the platform package _and_ the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack (you don't need to install the SDK)
2. [Download and install **Vagrant**](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
    - Be sure you can run Vagrant from the command line (try `vagrant -v` to test)
    - Windows users, you may need to run commands from a terminal created with Administrator privileges
3. [Signup for an account with **Infura**](https://infura.io) if you don't already have one

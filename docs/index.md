![event-logo](./event-logo.jpg)

Want to learn how easy it is to craft modern JSON-based APIs using Django REST Framework but can’t seem to find the time? Eager to dive into the emerging world of smart contracts and building on top of the Ethereum blockchain but don’t know where to start?

Join Rev1, SafeChain and Talio for a FREE, intensive, 3-hour bootcamp that will have you build a live RESTful API using Django REST Framework, run your first transaction on the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js and, finally, prove your abilities in our final challenge by claiming your one-of-a-kind Ohio token.

We’ll kick off the evening promptly at 6pm with a gentle introduction to models, routes and views in Django REST Framework and how to ease yourself into Python syntax (useful if you’re new or coming from another language such as .Net or Java.) You’ll then have an opportunity to dive right in to a live exercise to build your very first API endpoint on top of DRF with help from seasoned instructors and TAs from Talio.

From there, SafeChain will give an overview of how they’re using Ethereum blockchain to make real estate transactions more secure, followed by a brief group discussion of other potential applications. Lastly, Talio instructors will give a brief crash course on the fundamentals of Web3.js and how to run a transaction on the blockchain, after which attendees will dive into their second lab exercise of the evening.
